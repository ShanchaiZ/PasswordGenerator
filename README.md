# Introduction:
A Password Generator is a software tool that creates random or customizable passwords for users.
It helps the users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.

# Project's Aim:
As a part of User Story, a Password Generator will be created that meets certain criteria so that an employer with access to sensitive data can create a strong password to limit acess to sensitive data and have great security.

# Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS and Javascript

# What I have Learned:

1. This was my first application to Javascript coding and something I have been looking forward to take on.
2. The most difficult part of this project is keeping the javascript logic organized. I added several comments to clarify my understanding throughout javascript file for future reference.
3. Making and Explaning the "for" loop took more than than coding for other variables and constants.
4. Pseudocoding helps keep the javascript variables and logic organized.
5. I had fun with this project!!
